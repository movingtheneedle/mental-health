    <h1> <b> welcome. </b></h1>
    <p> this website is a school project made to reduce the stigma around mental health by educating people about what it is and why it's important to know the signs. mental health is important to know to help reduce the stigma, especially when others are struggling. it may allow for early intervention, help better understand the condition, create connections, and grow empathy. there's no way of really reading someone's emotions, but reducing the stigma may allows us to know beyond just the surface level and be able to help/care in a more detailed way. a stigma turns mental health into a weakness that stunts our growth, when in reality, it's okay not to be okay. a stigma forces people to supress, making them feel worse, adding to their issues. there are an infinite number of reasons why mental health should be considered a priority. </p>
