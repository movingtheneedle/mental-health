    <h1> <b> what can cause mental health issues? </b></h1>
    <p> there's a wide range of factors, including, but not limited to: traumatic experiences (example: childhood neglect/abuse, etc.), stressful situations (example: work/school-related, money issues), genetics/heredity, other conditions, relationships, complications during pregnancy, brain injury, bullying, social media, poverty/discrimination, and substance abuse. All of these can trigger reactions in the brain, affecting the mental health of the individual. </p>
    <h1> symptoms </h1>               
    <p> there's a numerous amount of symptoms mental issues can produce, but some examples are: mood swings, decreased energy/fatigue, confusion, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, sensitivity, strange thoughts, seeing experiencing extreme/bizarre delusions, sleep/appetite changes, difficulty thinking/functioning, and nervousness. While mental health issues don't seem as serious as physical health issues do, they both have a heavy weight on how much your body can take - which is why abandoning care for either condition can make you take a toll. This is another reasonn why mental health doesn't deserve the stereotypes people tend to put on it. </p>
